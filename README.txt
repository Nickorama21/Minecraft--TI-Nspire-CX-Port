README:

The Work in Progress is in /src/eclipse/, to edit open eclipse and set the workspace to that folder.

The decompiled original and the original game are under /base

Instructions on how to use the MCP are in /base/Minecraft Coder's Pack v72/docs/

TODO:
•Set the Gui to always be on fullscreen with a resolution of 320x240
•Rewrite default keystrokes to correlate with the calculator touchpad and keys
•Rewrite the keybinding process?
•Change the save handler to end all file extentions in .tns (eg. texture.png.tns)

Note: There might be more issues, but this is what needs to happen for now
